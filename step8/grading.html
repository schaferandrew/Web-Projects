<p>Step Grading </p>
<p>Name:   Andrew Schafer </p>
<p>When you have completed the step assignment, complete the following form by entering numbers where the blanks are and compute your assignment grade. Include this file as page in your step web site.  Enter the number of points you deserve for each grading category. You may enter partial points if you feel you have partially completed the category.</p>
<p>Total available points: 75 </p>
<p>For each item, if there is a request for the file and line number, indicate that as well so the TA can verify the code.</p>
<p>For each of the pages, deduct for elements you were unable to complete as a percentage of the page requirements or the specified point deductions for the tests that did not pass. List the elements you did not complete after the page name.</p>
<p>___10___	10 	Submitted correctly (naming, grading page, etc.)
</p>
<p>___5___	5 New cases entry working</p>
<p>____10__	10 Cases edit</p>
<p>___9__	10 Cases deletion including deletecase.php</p>
<p>__5____	5 New user process all works</p>
<p>__5___	5 Cancel when creating a new user</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Cancel in password validation page</p>
<p>__10__	10 Error messages in password validation page</p>
<p>___5__ 15 Ability to edit users</p>
<p>____64__	Total (please add the points and include the total here)</p>
<p>The grade you compute is the starting point for course staff, who reserve the right to change the grade if they disagree with your assessment and to deduct points for other issues they may encounter, such as errors in the submission process, naming issues, etc.</p>

<p> ******Notes*******: on delete case, radio button always sends the
last id as the post value. But the post/cases and
delete files are all present.

Radio button also proved to be an issue for edit users so the userview was updated to show
users but edit functionality wasn't included due to errors.</p>
